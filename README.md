El Mur Infernal Game
====================

This is a fullbody interactive game based on OF and OpenNI. It is the result of my final project in Computer Science career in Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
This game generates an avatar of the user made of 3D cubes distributed to simulate his body shape.

The main objective is that the avatar controlled by the user has to fit to walls, made of the same kind of cubes, which has a hole inside. The player has to try to get through the walls, and for each cube that is fitted, the game scores an amount of points, otherwise, the collided or empty blocks will him discount some points.
The player will increase his level through increasing his score.

As this project has been developed during the last course and working on a job, there's some points that could be improved in the future.

I'm publishing this code as open source hoping it could make some profit in research of fullbody interaction exergames.
